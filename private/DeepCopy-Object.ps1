function DeepCopy-Object
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates a deep copy of a serializable object.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Creates a deep copy of a serializable object.
        By default, PowerShell performs shallow copies (simple references)
        when assigning objects from one variable to another.  This will
        create full exact copies of the provided object so that they
        can be manipulated independently of each other, provided that the
        object being copied is serializable.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/PowerShellForGitHub

    .PARAMETER InputObject
        The object that is to be copied.  This must be serializable or this will fail.

    .EXAMPLE
        $bar = DeepCopy-Object -InputObject $foo
        Assuming that $foo is serializable, $bar will now be an exact copy of $foo, but
        any changes that you make to one will not affect the other.

    .RETURNS
        An exact copy of the PSObject that was just deep copied.
